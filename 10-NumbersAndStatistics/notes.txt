Bullet Points:

- A static method should be called using the class name rather than an object reference variable:

    Math.random() vs myFoo.go()

- A static method can be invoked without any instances of the method's class on the heap.

- A static method is good for a utility method that does not (and will never) depend on a particular instance variable value.

- A static method is notn associated with a particular instance- only the class- so it cannot access any instance variable values of its class. It wouldn't know which instance's values to use.

- If you have a class the only static methods, and you do not want the class to be instantiated, you can mark the constructor private.

- A static variable is a variable shared by all members of a given class. There is only a copy of a static variable in a class, rather than one copy per each individual instance for isntance variables.

- A static method can access a static varibale.

- To make a constant in JAVA, mark a variable as both static and final.

- A final static variable must be assigned a value either at the time it is declared, or in a static initalizer.

    static {
        DOG_CODE = 420;
    }

- The naming convention for constants (final static variables) is to make the name all uppercase.

- A final variable value cannot be changed once it has been assigned.

- Assigning a value to a final instance variable must be either at the time it is declared, or in the constructor.

- A final method cannot be overriden.

- A finall class cannot be extended (subclassed).
